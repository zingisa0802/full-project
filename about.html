        Jerusalem Ministries has two main arms -The first being the Restoration Ministry to the destitute and the second is the Human Dignity Centre which is a ministry to orphans and vulnerable children and the people who care for them.

        Jerusalem Ministries has, since 1995, developed an organization that has a heart for marginalized communities 
        and in a unique way managed to develop a relationship
        between two such communities so that they have become beneficial to each other. 
        The destitute and homeless, who are overcoming various forms of addictions, are part of a restorative project whereby they are given accommodation 
        and put through a program aimed at helping them fit back into society.
